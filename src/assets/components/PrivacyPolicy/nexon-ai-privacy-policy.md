## 6. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA & CALL RECORDING

### 6.1 Important: Call Recording Consent is YOUR Responsibility

**This is critical**: Nexon-AI provides the technical infrastructure for call recording, but **YOU** (the customer/controller) are responsible for ensuring:

#### Legal Basis for Recording
You must have one of the following lawful bases BEFORE recording any calls:

1. **Explicit Consent** (Most Common)
   - Caller must consent after being informed of the recording and its purpose
   - Implied consent (silence, continuing the call) is **NOT sufficient** under UK GDPR
   - Best Practice: "This call may be recorded for training and quality purposes. Press 1 to continue, Press 2 to decline."

2. **Legitimate Interest**
   - Recording is necessary for your legitimate business interests
   - Your interests do not override caller's fundamental rights
   - Must be transparent and fair
   - Example: Recording for quality assurance and training

3. **Legal Obligation**
   - Recording required by law or regulation
   - Example: Financial services recording requirements

4. **Contract Performance**
   - Recording is necessary to fulfill a contract with the caller
   - Example: Recording for dispute resolution

5. **Vital Interest Protection**
   - Recording necessary to protect someone's vital interests (rare)
   - Example: Emergency services recording

#### What YOU Must Do
- Display a clear privacy notice before calls are recorded
- Provide an easy way for callers to:
  - Consent to recording
  - Decline recording and proceed call
  - Request a copy of their recording later
- Maintain evidence of consent (call logs showing consent captured)
- Respond to data subject access requests (SARs) for their call recording
- Delete recordings upon request (within 1 month under GDPR)
- Inform the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) if required by incident response procedures

#### What Nexon-AI Does NOT Do
- Nexon-AI does NOT obtain consent on your behalf
- Nexon-AI does NOT verify your lawful basis
- Nexon-AI does NOT handle caller complaints or SARs directly (you must handle these)
- Nexon-AI does NOT provide privacy notices to your callers
- **You are solely responsible for compliance with call recording laws**

**Nexon-AI's Liability**: By using our Service, you warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents and complied with all call recording laws. You indemnify (hold harmless) Nexon-AI from any claims, fines, or damages arising from your failure to obtain consent or comply with call recording regulations.

### 6.2 Special Category Data & Biometric Data

**Voice Data Classification**: Call recordings and voice data are classified as **personal data** under UK GDPR. Additionally:

- **Voice data is inherently biometric**: Voice recordings contain unique, permanent characteristics that can identify an individual. Biometric data receives heightened protection under UK GDPR.

- **Special Category Status**: Voice data falls under "special category" (Article 9) data **only if** you use it to uniquely identify individuals (e.g., voice recognition systems). If you're simply recording conversations without using them for voice identification, they are personal data but not special category data.

**Sensitive Information Risk**: Voice recordings may reveal sensitive information including:
- Health conditions (tone, speech patterns may indicate health issues)
- Emotional state or mental health indicators
- Religious or philosophical views
- Financial information or account numbers
- Biometric identifiers

**Risk Mitigation**: If your business handles sensitive information in calls:
- Implement call redaction tools to scrub sensitive data from transcripts
- Restrict access to voice recordings to essential personnel only
- Implement role-based access controls
- Use encryption for stored recordings
- Minimize retention periods
- Train staff on handling sensitive information

**Nexon-AI's Role**: We provide the technical infrastructure for secure storage and access control. You must implement the business processes and policies for handling sensitive information.

### 6.3 Health & Medical Data (HIPAA, NHS Requirements)

**If you are a healthcare provider, therapist, or medical business:**

- Nexon-AI is NOT a HIPAA-compliant Business Associate (BA)
- Nexon-AI does NOT provide specific healthcare data protections
- You should NOT process PHI (Protected Health Information) through our Service without additional legal safeguards
- We recommend consulting with a legal advisor about HIPAA compliance if processing health data
